# Analysis of Aviation Accident Database Tables

This database contains multiple tables related to aviation accidents in America. Below is an analysis of what each table may contain based on their names:

## Table Descriptions

- **Country**: Likely contains country codes, names, and possibly region information for normalization and reference.
- **ct_iaids**: Possibly a code table for incident/accident identifiers (IAIDs), mapping codes to descriptions.
- **ct_seqevt**: Likely a code table for sequence of events, mapping event codes to their meanings.
- **dt_events**: Main event records, each row representing an accident or incident event, with references to other tables for details.
- **dt_Flight_Crew**: Details about flight crew involved in each event, such as roles, experience, and actions.
- **eADMSPUB_DataDictionary**: Data dictionary for the database, describing fields, types, and relationships for users and analysts.
- **engines**: Information about aircraft engines involved in events, including type, manufacturer, and performance data.
- **events**: Likely a summary or master table of all events, possibly with high-level details and links to other tables.
- **Events_Sequence**: Sequence of events for each accident, detailing the chronological order of occurrences leading to or during the event.
- **Flight_Crew**: General information about flight crew members, possibly linked to multiple events.
- **flight_time**: Flight time records, such as total hours, hours in type, recent experience, and time at the time of the event.
- **injury**: Injury records, detailing severity, type, and affected persons (crew, passengers, ground).
- **NTSB_Admin**: Administrative data from the NTSB, such as case management, docket numbers, and investigation status.
- **Occurrences**: Specific occurrences or findings within each event, such as system failures, weather phenomena, or procedural errors.
- **seq_of_events**: Sequence of coded events, possibly a normalized version of Events_Sequence for analysis.
- **states**: State codes and names for US states, used for location normalization.
- **aircraft**: Aircraft details, including type, registration, operator, and technical specifications.
- **dt_aircraft**: Detailed aircraft records linked to events, possibly including damage, configuration, and maintenance history.
- **Findings**: Investigation findings, such as probable cause, contributing factors, and safety recommendations.
- **narratives**: Narrative reports, including textual descriptions of events, investigation summaries, and witness statements.

## Summary

This database is structured to support comprehensive analysis of aviation accidents, with tables for:
- Event and occurrence tracking
- Crew and aircraft details
- Injury and administrative records
- Sequence and coding of events
- Location and normalization (country, state)
- Investigation findings and narrative reports

Such a schema enables detailed statistical, operational, and safety analysis for aviation accident research and regulatory oversight.
